<font size = +2> <B> Description. </B> </font>
 The USC ACMFNT REU provides undergraduates with an opportunity to experience research in a focused and supportive environment. Students work closely with faculty mentors and peers on current problems in analytic combinatorics and number theory, developing both technical skills and mathematical independence.

The program reflects USC’s strengths in analytic and combinatorial aspects of number theory, including topics related to integer partitions, modular forms, and arithmetic sequences. Participants are introduced to modern techniques and ideas that connect classical theory with contemporary methods.

The program is part of a broader and active number theory community at USC. The department regularly hosts and participates in regional conferences such as the Palmetto Number Theory Series (PANTS) and SERMON (Southeast Regional Meeting on Numbers), long-standing meetings that bring together researchers from across the Southeast. The core members of the PANTS consortium are the two flagship research universities of South Carolina — the Palmetto State — Clemson University and the University of South Carolina.

Through these connections, REU participants gain exposure to the wider mathematical community and the culture of contemporary research. Our goal is to create an environment where students can engage seriously with mathematics, build confidence in their abilities, and take meaningful steps toward future graduate study or research careers.
<!--
The Palmetto Number Theory Series (PANTS) is a series of number theory meetings held at colleges and universities in the Southeast since 2006. The core members of the PANTS consortium are the flagship research schools in the state of South Carolina, ``The Palmetto State":
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.math.clemson.edu/">Clemson University</a> 
<li><a href="http://www.math.sc.edu/">University of South Carolina</a>.  
</ul>
The goal of the PANTS meetings is to provide an opportunity for number theorists in South Carolina, and more generally, in the Southeast, to hear about recent research in all areas of number theory, pure and applied.

<p>

PANTS operates in coordination with <a href="https://huixue.people.clemson.edu/SERMON.html">SERMON</a> (Southeast Regional Meeting on Numbers), a meeting with similar goals that runs once a year in the Spring. SERMON was founded in 1988 at UNC-Greensboro.
